        		<h1>Harith, as a writer</h1>
			<p>I will explain why your brand sucks free of charge.
			</br>For a certain fee I will pretend to others that it doesn't.</p>
			<p>I have been writing for branding and commercial purporses since 2013.
			</br>Serious people have trusted me to lead their naming, tone of voice, messaging and copywriting projects.</p>
