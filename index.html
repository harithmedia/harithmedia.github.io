        		<h1>Harith, as a writer and strategist</h1>
			<p>I will explain why your company sucks free of charge.
			</br>For a certain fee I will pretend to others that it doesn't.</p>
			<p>Studios usually trust me to direct their naming, verbal identity, and copywriting projects.
			</br>I like to help teams think in terms of narratives, attitudes and behaviours.
			</br>I have been doing this since 2013.</p>

			<h3>My recent work</h3>

			<p>Ragged Edge is a branding agency in London that once hired me as a senior writer. 
			</br>The work we did together is my most recent and also my prettiest. This is a small fraction of it.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>East London Liquor Company is a distillery in East London. I occasionally give their spirits as gifts.
				</br>This work supported a succesful crowdfunding campaign, and also won a D&AD pencil for writing.

				<li>Bek is Europe's best performing venture capital fund. 
				</br>I helped them determine their identity and voice ahead of a strategic split from their parent VC.

				<li>Liberis opens up new lines of funding to small business merchants. 
				</br/>It does this by observing trends in their live sales data, rather than waiting for their end of year statements.
					</br><a href="https://www.liberis.com/" target="_blank">Website</a></li></br>

				<!--<li>Onto (fka Evezy) was a fully electric car subscription that raised $175m after this renaming and rebrand.
				</br>(They later entered administration when a market correction plunged the projected value of their 7,000 electic vehicles to a position of negative equity.)

				<!--<li>Multiply was a fun financial advice app that used AI to tell you where to keep your money. 
				</br>The company has since repositioned to target enterprise customers, and removed our fun bunny mascots.
					</br><a href="https://raggededge.com/work/multiply-branding/" target="_blank">Case Study</a></li></br>-->
				
				<li>Northzone is a prestigious venture capital firm from the Nordics. 
				</br>My slight discomfort with the VC industry is unrelated to my experiences working with Northzone.

				<!--<li>Permutive helps online publishers earn ad revenue without having to share their users' browising data.
				</br>It does this by processing data privately on the end user's device, without exposing their information to any third parties.

			</ul>

			<p>NOT Wieden+Kennedy is the branding and design arm of Wieden+Kennedy. I'm always very pleased to be able to collaborate with the team.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>VISA is an international payment provider. You probably have one of their cards.
				</br>I helped VISA decide how to introduce a new "click to pay" function, which is effectively going to be contactless for online.

			</ul>

			<p>Although I prefer to freelance at branding and design studios, I occasionally work direct with clients. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<!-- <li>BUFARMA (fka Domitia) is a range of skincare, made from organic buffalo milk, by a three generations of pharmacologists on their farm near Naples, Italy.
					</br><a href="https://https://bufarma.com/">Website</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bufarma_skincare/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li></br> -->

				<li>Kaelo is an open bottle host: it keeps wine chilled and the conversation flowing.
				</br>Our original creative strategy, which emphasised the special role of the host, have been superceded by more ordinary product messaging.
					</br><a href="https://kaelo.co.uk/">Website</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaelo_uk/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>I'll also collaborate with artists. Capitol Records, part of Universal Music Group, asked me to name one of their artists' upcoming releases.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"no one else, not even you" is an album by Mae Muller.
					</br><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1UDmqKMfVOddhkVd7qxC0Q?si=sojoC77ZSjCdo7G-O_conQ">Listen here</a> / <a href="https://store.universalmusic.com/maemuller/*/Merchandise/" target="_blank">Merch</a> / (This was the first time my writing appeared on a bucket hat.)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I also worked for Cambridge Analytica, in case you would sooner talk about that.</p>
