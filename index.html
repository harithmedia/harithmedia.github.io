        		<h1>Harith, as a brand writer</h1>
			<p>I will explain why your brand sucks free of charge.
			</br>For a certain fee I will pretend to others that it doesn't.</p>
			<p>Many companies have trusted me to lead their naming, tone of voice, and writing projects.
			</br>I have been doing this since 2013.</p>

			<h3>Recent work</h3>

			<p>Ragged Edge is a branding agency in London that decided to hire me as a senior writer. 
			</br>The work we did together is my most recent and also my prettiest. This is a small fraction of it.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>East London Liquor Company is a distillery in East London. I occasionally give their spirits as gifts.
				</br>This work won a D&AD pencil for writing.

				<li>Onto was a fully electric car subscription that raised $175m after this renaming and rebrand before entering liquidation when the value of their equity (a fleet of 7,000 electic vehicles) became negative.

				<li>Multiply was an app that used AI to tell you where to keep your money. This work was fun but the company has since repositioned to target enterprise customers.

				<li>Northzone is a venture capital firm. My quarrel with the VC industry is unrelated to my experiences working with Northzone.

				<li>Permutive uses on-device processing to help publishers earn money from their readers without selling their data.

			</ul>
			<p>Although I prefer to freelance at branding and design studios, I'll also work direct with clients. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>BUFARMA (fka "Domitia") is a line of skincare made from organic buffalo milk from a family farm outside of Naples, Italy.
					</br><a href="https://https://bufarma.com/">Website</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bufarma_skincare/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li></br>
				<li>Kaelo is an open bottle host: it keeps wine chilled and the conversation flowing.
					</br><a href="https://kaelo.co.uk/">Website</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kaelo_uk/" target="_blank">Instagram</a></li></br>
			</ul>
			<p>Capitol Records is part of Universal Music Group. They asked me to name one of their artists' upcoming releases.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"no one else, not even you" was an album by Mae Muller.
					</br><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1UDmqKMfVOddhkVd7qxC0Q?si=sojoC77ZSjCdo7G-O_conQ">Listen here</a> / <a href="https://store.universalmusic.com/maemuller/*/Merchandise/" target="_blank">Merch</a> / (This was the first time my writing appeared on a bucket hat.)</li></br>
			</ul>
			<p>I also worked for Cambridge Analytica, in case you would sooner talk about that.</p>

			<h3>Among other things</h3>
    		<ul>
    		<li>I completed an MA in Literary and Critical Theory at Goldsmiths in 2022.</li>
